# LegoLineFollower_ObstacleAvoidance_MazeSolver
Source code for implementation of a line follower robot which also avoids obstacles in the path and solves a maze. LegoKit has been used as hardware and the programming has been done in NXC
The robot starts with the line following, avoids obstacle in its path and finally solves a maze. A PID controller has been implemented for line following and obstacle avoidance. Maze solving is done using captured data from all the sides.
